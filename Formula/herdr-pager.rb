# herdr-pager's Homebrew formula, for the tap MaverickHQ/homebrew-tap:
#   brew install maverickhq/tap/herdr-pager
#   pager-bridge setup
#
# The release workflow writes it from contrib/homebrew/herdr-pager.rb.tmpl in
# github.com/MaverickHQ/herdr-pager (`tools/release/formula`), pinned to the
# archive that release built and published; the maintainer copies it to the
# tap. Edit the template there, not this file.

      Set up the pager with its setup page, in Chrome or Edge:
        pager-bridge setup
      It flashes the pager over USB, joins it to your Wi-Fi, pairs it, and can
      run the bridge at login (brew services start herdr-pager).

  # it fails, left stopped when it exits cleanly.
